* **Managing user expectations:** The bot always keeps the end-user apprised of the status of their requests. For example, the bot will notify end-user about the status changes (e.g. from unassigned to assigned). You should also leverage the help tab text to define and set expectations for requestors. For example, if you goal is to answer all queries within 24 hours, mention that within the help tab.

* **Setting your expert team for success:** Similar to knowledge base quality, the success of this app in your organization also depends hugely on the experts team you have. You would want to make sure they can reap the full benefits of this app in helping end-users. Following are the items you should consider:

	* Involve them in the installation process, show them how the full app works - there are three big components - end-user bot; bot notifications in the general channel of the team; Messaging extension that enables experts to quickly shift through assigned/unassigned request.

	* Set up expectations with end-users and empower the specialists to deliver those expectations. For example, ensure that all queries do get resolved within 24 hours or the end-user is apprised of what's taking longer than usual. This will build confidence and you'd have returning end-users.

	* Leverage the 'Help Tab'. Use this tab to document process you'd like your end-users to follow. For example, giving them a lay of the land on what kind of questions they can ask and under what conditions they should escalate to asking an expert are good candidates for such content.

* **Configuring answers as rich cards instead of normal text based answers:** 

The knowledge base quality can be enhanced by configuring answers using rich cards, to provide additional information such as image, article url pertaining to question. Some of fields in the rich card support markdown to emphasize the message, keywords.
