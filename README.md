description: FAQ Plus bot is a friendly Q&A bot that brings a human in the loop when it is unable to help. One can ask the bot a question and the bot responds with an answer if it's in the knowledge base. If not, the bot allows the end-user to submit a query which then gets posted in a pre-configured team of experts to provide support by acting upon the notifications from within their team itself.

FAQ Plus bot is a friendly Q&A bot that brings a human in the loop when it is unable to help. One can ask the bot a question and the bot responds with an answer if it's in the knowledge base.
